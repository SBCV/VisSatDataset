Note:

1. The images are organized and numbered according to their capture time. The image name is formatted as:
   <image id>_<sensor name>_<date>_<time>_<unique string generated by the satellite imagery vendor>

2. The camera parameters in perspective_cameras.json is organized as:
	image_width, image_height, fx, fy, cx, cy, s, qw, qx, qy, qz, tx, ty, tz
   where,
       * (fx, fy, cx, cy, s) are camera intrinsics;
       * (qw, qx, qy, qz) are the quaternion representation of the rotation matrix;
       * (tx, ty, tz) are the translation vector.

   These camera parameters are acquired by first approximating the RPC cameras, and then 
   we bundle-adjust all the cameras via COLMAP SfM.

3. In aoi.json, there're bounding boxes for this site (or area of interest) in the two global coordinate systems: 
       * (UTM east, UTM north, altitude)
       * (latitude, longitude, altitude)

4. ground-truth.tif is a GeoTIFF file that can be viewed by QGIS (https://qgis.org/en/site/). 
   Basically, it's the ground-truth height map for the site measured by airborne lidar. The height map is defined
   in the global coordinate system (UTM east, UTM north, altitude).
